# CrumpBrosowskyMilliken_QJEP
This data repository contains the raw data for each experiment from:

Crump, M. J. C., Brosowsky, N., and Milliken, B. (In Press). Reproducing the location-based context-specific proportion congruent effect for frequency unbiased items: A reply to Hutcheon and Spieler (2016). Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, OnlineFirst.

Included in each folder are data files in .csv format, Rmarkdown files with scripts for the analyses carried out on the data, and html files showing the results of the analysis.

## Library files

The rmarkdown scripts depend on several R libraries available from CRAN. Additionally, the outlier removal function and standard error function depend on the Crump lab R package (Crump_1.0.tar.gz)
